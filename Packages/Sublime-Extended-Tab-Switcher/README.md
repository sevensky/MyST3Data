Extended tab switcher for Sublime Text
==================================================

**This plugin is inspired by the default tab switcher in netbeans**	 which displays the open files to choose from. View all open files (sorted/unsorted) for switching between them.


## Key Bindings

* On pressing `ctrl+alt+tab` all open files will be displayed for selection.
* On pressing `ctrl+alt+shift+tab` only open files in the active group will be displayed for selection.


User can change the default key binding at `Preferences -> Package Settings -> Extended Tab Switcher -> Key Bindings User`



## Configurations
User can overwrite the following configurations by adding flags in the User - Settings section which can be access by `Preferences -> Package Settings -> Extended Tab Switcher -> Settings - User`

* Sorting

	By default the the files are sorted in the order of "open files" in the side bar. To enable the sorting the user can change the defauly key binding and adding the following flag in the settings

	```javascript
	{
		"sort": "true"
	}
	```

* Skip current file

	By default the current active file/view is also displayed within the selection of the open files. This can be overwritten by adding the following flag in the settings

	```javascript
	{
		"skip_current_file": "true"
	}
	```


* Mark dirty file

	By default all the dirty/unsaved files are marked with "*". This can be overwritten by adding the following flag in the settings


	Tip: This character can be also use to view all the unsaved files while searching the open files


	```javascript
	{
		"mark_dirty_file_char": "<your-char>" 
	}

	```

* Show full file path

		"show_full_file_path": true 
	}

	```
