Console Exec
============

Plugin for [Sublime Text][sublime] to execute a command in a console
window. After the process exits, the console remains open and displays
**"Press any key to exit"** before closing.

This plugin is based on the exec command shipped with Sublime Text, and
uses the launcher that ships with [Crimson Editor][crimson]
to wait for a keypress before closing the window.

Why?
----

Aside from personal preference of having an external console in web projects,

- Sublime leaves your background process running when you quit
- Rebuilding a project overwrites your running process, leaking processes if you're not careful
- Certain environments such as [Pyglet][] will not run within the integrated console window

This plugin ties these loose ends in a familiar way.

Usage
-----

In any **.sublime-build** file add the following line to run it in a console:

    "target": "console_exec"

For example, here's a modified **Python.sublime-build** file:

    {
        "cmd": ["python", "-u", "$file"],
        "file_regex": "^[ ]*File \"(...*?)\", line ([0-9]*)",
        "selector": "source.python",
        "target": "console_exec"
    }

Note: you can find the appropriate build file from **"Browse Packages..."**


Installation
------------

With [Sublime Package Control][package_control], simply

1. Select **Package Control: Install Package** from the command palette
2. Locate **ConsoleExec** and press enter to install it
